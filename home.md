# Welcome üëã

Ever wished you could skip the line at the checkout?  
That‚Äôs (kind of) what I do ... but with equations.

I‚Äôm R√©my Vallot, PhD candidate in Applied Mathematics at ENS Paris-Saclay (Centre Borelli), working with Michelin.  
I study nonlinear solvers, algorithms that solve tough equations, and I try to make them converge faster. Much faster.



## What's the problem?

Solvers are like queues: they start somewhere and go step-by-step until they reach the solution.  
But starting from scratch is slow, and each step takes time. I look for smart ways to:

> üîÅ start **closer to the answer** (smart initialization)

> ‚ö° make **each step more effective** (better iterations)

I use tools from optimization, physics, and machine learning ‚Äî with a special love for POD (*Proper Orthogonal Decomposition* for newcomers).

Want to understand how skipping queues relates to solving equations?</br>

# Outside math?

I‚Äôm passionate about creativity whether it‚Äôs through music, composing, drawing, animation, or coding playful ideas.
